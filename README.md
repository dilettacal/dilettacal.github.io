# Diletta Calussi - Portfolio 🚀

> **Note**: This is my personal portfolio built using the [DeveloperFolio](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) template by [Saad Pasta](https://github.com/saadpasta). Full credit goes to Saad and all the amazing contributors who built this fantastic portfolio template. See the [Credits](#credits) section below.

My personal portfolio website showcasing my professional experience as a Data Engineer and AI Engineer. Built with React and heavily customized to highlight my work in data engineering, NLP, and AI systems.

## ⚠️ Personal Data Notice

**The content in `src/data/` folder is personal and proprietary.** 

- ✅ **You CAN** use the code, structure, and configuration system
- ❌ **You CANNOT** use the personal data (work history, education, certifications, etc.)

If you want to use this as a template:
1. Replace ALL JSON files in `src/data/` with your own information
2. Follow the structure documented in [DATA_STRUCTURE.md](DATA_STRUCTURE.md)
3. See [src/data/README.md](src/data/README.md) for details

**Using someone else's professional history is unethical and potentially illegal.**

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note**: This section is primarily for my own development workflow. If you're looking for a portfolio template to use, I recommend checking out the [original DeveloperFolio project](https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio) instead, which is actively maintained as a template.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dilettacal/developerFolio.git
cd developerFolio
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to fetch GitHub profile data:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your GitHub tokens if needed.

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🎨 Customization

### 📚 Documentation

This portfolio uses a **JSON-based configuration system** for easy content management:

- **[DATA_STRUCTURE.md](DATA_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete guide to the JSON data structure
- **[OPTIONAL_SECTIONS_GUIDE.md](OPTIONAL_SECTIONS_GUIDE.md)** - How to enable blogs, podcasts, resume, etc.
- **[JSON_FILES_REFERENCE.md](JSON_FILES_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick reference of all JSON files

### Update Personal Information

All personal information and content is stored in **JSON files** in the `src/data/` folder. No React knowledge needed!

#### Quick Examples

1. **Update Work Experience** - Edit `src/data/experience.json`:
```json
{
  "experiences": [
    {
      "role": "Your New Role",
      "company": "Company Name",
      "companyLogoKey": "company_key",
      "date": "Start – End",
      "desc": "What you do",
      "descBullets": ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Update Skills** - Edit `src/data/skills.json`:
```json
{
  "skills": [
    "⚡ Your skill description 1",
    "⚡ Your skill description 2"
  ]
}
```

3. **Update Contact Info** - Edit `src/data/profile.json`:
```json
{
  "greeting": {
    "title": "Hi, I'm Your Name",
    "subTitle": "Your professional summary"
  },
  "socialMediaLinks": {
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
  }
}
```

4. **Add Certifications** - Edit `src/data/achievements.json`:
```json
{
  "achievementsCards": [
    {
      "title": "Your Certification",
      "subtitle": "Description",
      "imageKey": "udemy",
      "footerLink": [{"name": "View", "url": "cert-url"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

**See [DATA_STRUCTURE.md](DATA_STRUCTURE.md) for complete documentation!**

### Update Colors

Edit `src/_globalColor.scss` to change the color scheme:

```scss
$primaryColor: #your-color;
$secondaryColor: #your-color;
// ... other color variables
```

### Add Custom Images

Place your images in `src/assets/images/` and reference them in `portfolio.js`:

```javascript
companylogo: require("./assets/images/your-image.png")
```

### Customize Animations

Replace Lottie animation files in `src/assets/lottie/` with your own JSON animation files from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/).

## 📦 Available Scripts

## 🎯 Key Files to Modify

1. **`src/portfolio.js`** - All personal information and content
2. **`src/_globalColor.scss`** - Color theme
3. **`public/index.html`** - Page title and meta tags
4. **`package.json`** - Homepage URL for deployment
5. **`src/assets/images/`** - Replace with your own images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is already in use, React will prompt you to use a different port, or you can specify one:
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Build Errors
Clear cache and reinstall dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Deployment Issues
Make sure the `homepage` in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL exactly.
